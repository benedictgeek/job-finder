 I want to create an app that scrapes the web for job applications, a UI that has a section to search and another section to display results with the job description and validity.                                                 
                                                                                                                    
  Would also need to have to store some data in a DB, I am think SQL lite, this would keep track of jobs I have applied to and also status of the application.

  We would pull data from the DB and also display on this app list of existing applications.
